Object detection software_Inside_FPV_track

Objective: 
To detect object and road blocks using visual odometry.

Technology used:
Tensorflow lite integrated with flutter

Project description:
We tried to build a robust project that satisfied the industrial problem statement given to us.

We divided this project into 4 main steps: Start, Detect, Stop, Move.
When detected by the camera, there are two possibilities: obstacle or object. When obstacle comes, it will stop and move. When object (ships and boats, according to the problem statement) is detected, it will identify it.

It has two additional features: it can capture images and manual override for emergency reboots.
